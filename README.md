# Scape

Scape is an immersive desktop environment streaming app for visionOS built from Mirage that streams individual macOS windows into a 3D environment using [MirageKit](https://github.com/EthanLipnik/MirageKit).
Also, if this is considered competing I am totally down to just integrate this into Mirage itself you can like take this I don't mind.
